# ConsoleMinesweeper

## How to play

- The goal of the game is to uncover all 10 hidden and random placed mines.
- You can uncover a field, if you type its coordinates into terminal (eg. "3 3"). Do this only when you are sure this field isn't a mine, otherwise you will lose.
- If you want to mark a field which contains a mine, type its coordinates + M (eg. "3 3 M"). Be careful! If you mark a field which does not contain a mine, you will lose.
- Player wins after marking all 10 mines.
